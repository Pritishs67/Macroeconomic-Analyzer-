Macro Trends and Leadership Dynamics
Objective
Analyze and compare macroeconomic performance across US cities to classify economic trends and identify leadership dynamics.

Project Overview
This project involves the following steps:

Data Collection: Scraping macroeconomic data using Selenium.
Data Transformation: Processing and transforming the collected data using Python.
Statistical Analysis: Implementing a scoring model and quadratic analysis to classify city economic trends.
Visualization: Creating interactive Power BI dashboards for reporting economic dynamics and leadership trends among US cities.
Insights
The project aims to derive the following insights:

Regional Economic Disparities: Identify cities with robust economic growth versus those facing stagnation or decline.
Impact of Policy Changes: Assess how local and national policies influence economic indicators like GDP and unemployment rates.
Sectoral Analysis: Understand which sectors (retail, manufacturing, services) drive economic growth or contraction in different cities.
Population Dynamics: Explore correlations between population growth or decline and economic performance.
Comparative Benchmarking: Compare cities categorized as leaders, strugglers, laggards, and emergents to understand underlying factors contributing to their economic status.
Forecasting Economic Trends: Use historical data and statistical models to forecast potential future economic scenarios for different cities.
Policy Recommendations: Provide insights to policymakers on effective strategies for fostering economic growth and resilience in cities.
Steps to Execute the Project
1. Data Collection
Tools: Selenium
Data Sources: CPI, GDP, unemployment, personal income, retail sales, population data
Description: Use Selenium to automate the process of web scraping data from various reliable sources. Ensure data is stored in a structured format (e.g., CSV files).
2. Data Transformation
Tools: Python, Pandas
Description:
Load the scraped data.
Clean and preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, format data types).
Transform the data into a suitable format for analysis.
3. Statistical Analysis
Tools: Python, Scikit-Learn
Description:
Implement a scoring model to evaluate economic performance indicators.
Perform quadratic analysis to classify cities into categories: Struggler, Laggard, Leader, Emergent.
4. Visualization
Tools: Power BI
Description:
Create interactive dashboards to visualize economic dynamics.
Include various charts and graphs to represent data insights clearly.
Ensure the dashboards are user-friendly and provide drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis.
