# Macroeconomic-Analyzer-
Assessing Macro Trends and Leadership Dynamics
Objective: Analyze and compare macroeconomic performance across US cities.
Data Collection: Use Selenium for scraping CPI, GDP, unemployment, personal income, retail sales, and population data.
Data Transformation: Utilize Python for processing and transformation of collected data.
Statistical Analysis: Implement scoring model and quadratic analysis (Struggler, Laggard, Leader, Emergent) to classify city economic trends.
Visualization: Create interactive Power BI dashboards for reporting economic dynamics and leadership trends among US cities.
 

Certainly! Here are some useful insights that could be derived from this project:
Regional Economic Disparities: Identify cities with robust economic growth versus those facing stagnation or decline.
Impact of Policy Changes: Assess how local and national policies influence economic indicators like GDP and unemployment rates.
Sectoral Analysis: Understand which sectors (retail, manufacturing, services) drive economic growth or contraction in different cities.
Population Dynamics: Explore correlations between population growth or decline and economic performance.
Comparative Benchmarking: Compare cities categorized as leaders, strugglers, laggards, and emergents to understand underlying factors contributing to their economic status.
Forecasting Economic Trends: Use historical data and statistical models to forecast potential future economic scenarios for different cities.
Policy Recommendations: Provide insights to policymakers on effective strategies for fostering economic growth and resilience in cities.
